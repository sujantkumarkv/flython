## Hello World, 

## I'll push it to open-source as a fun little project attempt. Don't know if it's ever gonna be big or even if it's possible to BUIDL it.

# Yep, the name is FLYTHON :)
## to make python not RUN fast but FLY giving it real wings unlike RedBull ;)

## The name is STRICTLY kept so for FUN ...

## The idea:
### Inspired from a medium article that addressed the fundamental problem as to why python is slow..
### That's the tradeoff being a high-level language as we all know. It used some low-level computation techniques to make code run faster using NUMPY arrays probably. 
## So I thought if it can be made into a more general python module kind-of where using it then fastens up the whole code overall or not. I don't know if this can be made into something ready-to-use or not but let's try :)
